Ewald's note:
<blockquote>This file is taken from the NWN Custom Content Guide wiki
(http://ccg.dladventures.com). I removed some stuff that the java JTextPane
class couldn't handle and added anchor tags to the different
column names (e.g. &lt;a name="MetaMagic"&gt;) to make it work
as help file in my 2da editor.</blockquote>
<h1>spells.2da</h1>
<p>NB: in what follows when we mention a "spell" it isn't necessarily a <b>true spell</b>,
if it is the case it will be made explicit. It can be anything this 2da
can implement: cast-spell item property, useable feat, racial capacity...</p>
<p>For specifics about spells, and monster abilities see Spells.<br>
Useable feats, class-specific Abilities (Special Ability menu of the
player) or racial Abilities see Feats.<br>
For item properties see ItemProperties,
if what you want are spell-like properties (useable from the item) iprp_spells.2da should contain all the info you need
besides this page.</p>
<p>We will use the mention <i>True Spell Only</i> for a column whose
value only applies to Wizard, cleric etc spells or innate Monster
spell-like abilities (those found in the toolset in the "cast spell"
list). This generally means that for other features (feats and
cast-spell properties in particular) this value is overruled in an
other 2da, but not that you can leave the entry blank.</p>
<p>The spell resource file - spells.2da defines each of the spells, how
it is cast, who can cast it, and a variety of other details. There are
eight main parts to a spells.2da record.</p>
<ol>
  <li>General information (spell name, school, range, etc.)</li>
  <li>What classes can use the spell and what level it is</li>
  <li>The Conjuration group which stores the sounds and animations that
are played when the spell is being cast.</li>
  <li>The Cast group which stores the sounds and animations that are
executed when the caster is done chanting and the spell takes effect.
This is not the effect on the recipient -- that is handled in the ImpactScript
-- but is, for example, the animation for the cone of frost between the
caster and target in a cone of cold spell. Cast effects take place
after Conjuration effects. Refer to the spell effects reference near
the end of this tutorial for details on effects you can use.</li>
  <li>The Projectile group. This one designates any type of model that
moves between the caster and the target. An example would be the ball
of the fireball spell that travels from the caster&#8217;s hand to the target
and then explodes.</li>
  <li>A list of immunities.</li>
  <li>Linked spells. This is where you can designate a spell to have more
than one type of end effect, similar to a Polymorph spell where you can
pick from several options. Linked effects are used for radial menus.</li>
  <li>Miscellaneous information.</li>
</ol>

I want a spell that can be Quickened, Silent, Still, and Maximized. I
would have 8(Quicken) + 16(Silent) + 32(Still) + 4(Maximize) = 60 total.<br>
Once you get the number you need to convert it into hex format. The
easiest way if you use Windows is to use the calculator.<br>
Open up the Calculator program in Windows and under the View menu, switch to
scientific mode. Make sure the round radio button is checked for Dec.
Enter in your number and then change it from Dec to Hex; this is your
hexadecimal number. Enter this number along with a 0x (just
programmer&#8217;s notation that a number is in hexadecimal format) to the

wildshape). Prior to HotU using subradial spells with feats is not
possible at all.

The actual effect is that the uses-per-day of the master spell is reduced

Subspells without this seem to work, at least last time I checked, and
it might have an interest, but it comes without waranty, since Bioware
never uses it this way.</td>

  ```console
  java -jar TlkEditInstallerR10.jar

    if you open more than 3 full size ( ca. 8MB ) tlk files the java vm will run out of memory.
    (if this troubles you, you can start java with `java -XmxYYYM ...` to allow the vm to use up to YYY MB of memory,  default is 64MB)

-------
- Added support for tlk diff files created with "save diff..." in the tlk editor (files must be called `diff.tlu`)
